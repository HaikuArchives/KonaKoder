<title>Installation</title>
<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
The installation is the most complex part of using KonaKoder. While I would love to just distribute binaries of KonaKoder, I would get sued into the Stone Age if I did. However, with a little luck and some detailed instructions, you should not have any problems.
<p>
First, you will need to gather up some other packages. First and foremost, you will need to get a copy of the 8Hz MP3 encoder source code. It's named <pre>8hz-mp3.src.v02b.tar.gz</pre> If you search on some of the big search sites like <a href="http://ftpsearch.lycos.com">Lycos</a>, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> or <a href="http://www.alta-vista.com">AltaVista</a>, you should be able to find it. Just save it anywhere on your disk drive. You don't need to worry about expanding it, the installer will take care of that.
<p>
Second, you will need some of Marco's great stuff. Grab a copy of his PrefServer and liblayout on his web page <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~marcone/be.html">here.</a>
<p>
Once you've downloaded the latest copies, install them according to Marco's directions. You could get by without these, but KonaKoder won't save your preferences. While you're there, check out some of the other neat stuff he's written. If you look carefully, you'll find his version of the 8Hz MP3 encoder along with his excellent SoundPlay app.
<p>
Now that you have all the pieces, just double click on the "Install Program" in the KonaKoder directory. It will find the 8Hz source code, put it in the proper place, patch it, and then build KonaKoder. This will take several minutes, and the Install Program will put up a window when it's done.
<p>
Congratulations, you should now have a working copy of KonaKoder. That wasn't so bad, was it? If you find that the build process has failed for some reason, try running the install program from a Terminal window. It will produce verbose output which may help you isolate the problem.
