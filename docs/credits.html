<h1>Credits</h1>
KonaKoder was written with the help of a number of people, who contributed either code or inspiration. This is hopefully a complete list of the people I need to thank.
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, I need to thank the folks at <a href="http://www.8hz.com">8hz</a> who indirectly provided the source code used by KonaKoder.
<li><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~marcone/index.html">Marco Nelissen.</a> Marco wrote the PrefServer which KonaKoder uses to save your preferences. He has also written a number of other great BeOS programs. You can check out his BeOS software <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~marcone/be.html">here.</a>
<li><a href="http://www.webfire.com/~cpaul/">Chip Paul</a> wrote the CDDBLooper class which KonaKoder uses for CDDB access. It was originally release as part of his BeOS program <a href="http://www.webfire.com/~cpaul/Jukebox/">Jukebox</a>, a nice CD player application he wrote.
<li>Ti Kan and Steve Scherf gave the world the CDDB database which is an integral part of KonaKoder. Since I began work on KonaKoder, CDDB has gone commercial. The place to go to find our more information about CDDB is <a href="http://www.cddb.com">www.cddb.com</a>
<li>Jonas Sundstrom provided some inspiration and help in standardizing the names and types of the attributes used for MP3 files. He's written a number of MP3 tools for the BeOS. You can check out his stuff <a href="http://home.beoscentral.com/mirilla/">here</a>.
<li>I can't forget all the great folks at <a href="http://www.be.com">Be Inc.</a> for writing the BeOS and building the BeBox. I could carry on and on about the great feature of the BeOS, but chances are that if you are reading this you already know them.
<li>Special thanks to <a href="http://www.mediapede.com">Mediapede</a> for making me change the name of my program. I had been using the name SuperEncode for my program, but when they released their MP3 encoder UltraEncode I figured that I would only confuse things and irritate their legal staff if I released an encoder with such a similar name.  UltraEncode is a slick program that has a few features lacking in KonaKoder. It has some downsides too, such as being Intel-only. However, it is worth checking out.
<li>I also need to thank my wife, Jeanne, for putting up with me spending far too much time on KonaKoder. Maybe now that it's released, I'll start making it to dinner on time.
<li>Last, but not least, our dog Kona for providing a new name and an icon for KonaKoder. 
</ul>
Well, I'm sure I missed somebody, so to those of you I missed Thanks!
